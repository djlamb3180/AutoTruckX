# Steering Angle Prediction

### 1 Model Architecture

Three models were experimented:
* TruckResnet18: Lighter vesion of Resnet50. 
* TruckResnet50: A CNN transfer learning model utilizing feature maps extracted by ResNet50, connected to additional fully-connected layers. This model was adapated and modified from Du et al.'s 2019 paper [*Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05440). The first 141 layers of the ResNet50 layers (instead of the first 45 layers as in the original paper) were frozen from updating. Dimensions of the fully-connected layers were also modified.
* GoogLeNet:

### 2 Regression Loss

The loss function is the standard MSE loss between the predicted and groundtruth steering angles, as implemented in [torch.nn.MSELoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html). For all three models, the mean of all tensor elements' MSE loss was used.

### 3 Dataset

The models were trained on driving scene images simulated and extracted from [Udacity's self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The [dataset (~1.35GB)](https://www.kaggle.com/zaynena/selfdriving-car-simulator) contains 97330 images (320x160) with steering angles labelled. 

### 4 Training

Models were trained on Tesla T4 on Google Colab. 

All three models were first trained with 20 epochs, 1e-4 learning rate. For TruckNN and TruckResnet50, batch size is set to be 32, and that of TruckRNN is set to be 8. It was observed that TruckResnet50 out-performs other models, and hence was further trained to 40 epochs with early stopping tolerance of 10 epochs. Yet, no improvement of the loss was observed.

### 5 Results and Visualization

The best validation loss observed is 0.066 MSE (or 0.25) from TruckResnet50, which is worse than the loss claimed in the paper by an entire degree. Possible contributing factors include model architecture (design and/or complexity), lack of training resources, limited dataset, difference in dataset content (simulator vs real world) and environmental variances, etc.

Despite of this, it can be observed that the models' predictions are reasonable to a high degree.

For further visualization, saliency maps of the last Resnet50 Convolutional layer (layer4) can be observed as below:

The model seems to possess salient features on the road.

### 6 Model training or testing instructions

Pretrained checkpoints for TruckNN and TruckRNN can be found in `checkpoints` directory. Checkpoint for TruckResnet50 can be downloaded via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9DB27bXgqySR7fRcAHog6xr2d-fRQCh/view?usp=sharing). For usage, proceed to place it to `./checkpoints/TruckResnet50/best_ckpt_1.pth`.
