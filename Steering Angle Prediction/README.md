# Steering Angle Prediction

### 1 Model Architecture

Three models were experimented:
* TruckResnet18: Lighter vesion of Resnet50. Has 18 Layers. 
* TruckResnet50: A CNN transfer learning model utilizing feature maps extracted by ResNet50, connected to additional fully-connected layers. This model was adapated and modified from Du et al.'s 2019 paper [*Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05440). The first 141 layers of the ResNet50 layers (instead of the first 45 layers as in the original paper) were frozen from updating. Dimensions of the fully-connected layers were also modified.
* GoogLeNet: Is based on a CNN architecture codenamed "Inception".

Resnet50 and Resnet18 figures are extracted from their original papers respectively. GoogLeNet figure was pulled from pytorch.org.   

### 2 Regression Loss

The loss function is the standard MSE loss between the predicted and groundtruth steering angles, as implemented in [torch.nn.MSELoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html). For all three models, the mean of all tensor elements' MSE loss was used.

### 3 Dataset

The models were trained on driving scene images simulated and extracted from [Udacity's self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The [dataset (~1.35GB)](https://www.kaggle.com/zaynena/selfdriving-car-simulator) contains 97330 images (320x160) with steering angles labelled. 

### 4 Training

Models were trained on Nvidia RTX 2070. 

All three models were trained with 50 epochs, 1e-4 learning rate and batch size is set to be 128. It was observed that GoogLeNet out-performs other models.

### 5 Results and Visualization

The best validation loss observed is 0.064 MSE from TruckResnet50, which is worse than the loss claimed in the paper by an entire degree.

The best validation loss observed is 0.124 MSE from TruckResnet18, which is the worse out of the three models.

The best validation loss observed is 0.059 MSE from GoogLeNet.

Will add visualization soon.
