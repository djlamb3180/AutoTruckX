# Steering Angle Prediction

## Model Architecture ##

Three models were experimented:
* TruckResnet18: Lighter version of Resnet50. Has 18 Layers. 
* TruckResnet50: A CNN transfer learning model utilizing feature maps extracted by ResNet50, connected to additional fully-connected layers. This model was adapated and modified from Du et al.'s 2019 paper [*Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05440). The first 141 layers of the ResNet50 layers (instead of the first 45 layers as in the original paper) were frozen from updating. Dimensions of the fully-connected layers were also modified.
* GoogLeNet: Is based on a CNN architecture codenamed "Inception".

Resnet50 and Resnet18 figures are extracted from their original papers respectively. GoogLeNet figure was pulled from pytorch.org.   

## Regression Loss ##

The loss function is the standard MSE loss between the predicted and groundtruth steering angles, as implemented in [torch.nn.MSELoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html). For all three models, the mean of all tensor elements' MSE loss was used.

## Dataset ##

The models were trained on driving scene images simulated and extracted from [Udacity's self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The [dataset (~1.35GB)](https://www.kaggle.com/zaynena/selfdriving-car-simulator) contains 97330 images (320x160) with steering angles labelled. 

## Training ##

Models were trained on Nvidia RTX 2070 using Anaconda.

OS: Windows 10 Pro version 21H1

All three models were trained with 50 epochs, 1e-4 learning rate and batch size is set to be 128. It was observed that GoogLeNet out-performs other models.

## Results and Visualization ##

The best validation loss observed is 0.058 MSE from TruckResnet50, which is better than Resnet18 and GoogleNet.

## Known Issues ##

* When running on windows, a thread error can occur due to windows having poor parrallel computing. Fix: run this command `python train.py --workers 0`
* Due to the originals RNN models, training uses CPU heavily. This has not be fully optimized to use cuda only. 
* Some files may not work correctly due to some parts being loaded on the GPU and others loaded onto CPU.
